You may now connect AX3 devices.

Troubleshooting tips:

* You should re-connect any devices that are already connected.

* The devices must either be directly connected to the PC or connected via a hub or docking station that is powered.

* Check in Windows Device Manager - correctly installed devices should appear under "Ports".

* If the devices are listed under "Unknown Devices", right-click and select "Update Driver Software" (requires administrator privileges).  If "Search Automatically" does not work, try "Browse my computer" and choose the installation folder.
